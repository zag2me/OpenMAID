Start by backing up the existing maid directory and the existing maid MySQL database.
We may need these if anything goes horribly wrong below.


1. Create new maid directory or delete ALL contents of existing maid directory if
   reusing this location for OpenMAID v2

2. Ungzip openmaid_source.gzip to this maid directory.  Source archive is located at:
   http://207.44.156.88/~vinny/OpenMaid/openmaid_source.gzip
   Can be regenerated from the admin page (http://207.44.156.88/~vinny/OpenMaid/admin.php).
   Click the Archive Source Code link in the menu on the right side of the admin page.

3. Create new db in Meedios MySQL account for the OpenMAID v2 db.  Don't reuse the 
   existing db!

4. Edit config.php file to reflect proper db info and be sure url and directory info is
   correct.

5. Go to the admin.php script

6. In right-menu, select Initialize Directories

7. In right-menu, select Initialize Database

8. In right-menu, select Sync w/Meedio MAID  (This will sync the repository directory with
   meedios openmaid v2 beta site, meedios openmaid v1, and meedio maid)

9. Refresh the admin.php page

10. Under FTP Uploads/Repository, on the line that has 'Auto or Manual Process New Plugins', 
    click the Manual link to go to the Manage New Plugins page.

11. On the Manage New Plugins page near the top by Global Process, click the [ignore sanity 
    errors and force db update] link.  It processes 25 plugins at a time and provides a link
    at the bottom of the results to continue processing.  Ignore all errors that are
    reported due to sanity checks.

12. Continue processing until all plugins have been processed.

13. Goto admin.php and click Sync Profile ID w/old DB link from right-menu

14. Test to be sure everything is working.

15. Done
